# autonomous_car_first
my autonomous car project


algorithm from: https://www.youtube.com/c/MurtazasWorkshopRoboticsandAIa


file description:

utils.py: save functions

lanedetect.py: calculate road's curve value and send value to arduino through serial communication

auto.ino: **cracked**

auto_non_serial.ino: It doesn't have any serial sending functions to prevent crash on serial communication with python

auto_simple.ino: simplyfied and improved handling algorithm



made in JEJU
